# Loan-Status-Prediciton_-Coursera-Capstone-Project
Predicting the customer loan status using various ML Classification Algorithms

Used various algorithms on the same data such as:

Decision Tress 
K-Nearest Neighbors 
Support Vector Machines
Logistic regression 

In the end generated a classification score report for each model to compare the model accuracies, ouit of whcih SVM have shown best performace among all the models used.
